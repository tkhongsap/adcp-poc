      "content": "Done. The **GreenEnergy Co** campaign has been paused and delivery has stopped immediately.\n\n### What Happened:\n- ✅ Campaign status changed from **active** → **paused**\n- 🛑 All ad delivery stopped - no further spend will occur\n- 📧 Notifications sent to team via Slack and email draft generated\n\n### Final Stats (at pause):\n- **Total Spend:** $14,900 of $20,000 budget (75% utilized)\n- **Performance:** 1.12M impressions, 56 conversions, $266 CPA\n- **Remaining Budget:** $5,100 (unspent)\n\nI know it was performing well with good health and efficient CPA, but sometimes business priorities change. The campaign can be resumed anytime if needed. \n\nWould you like me to reallocate the remaining budget to any of the other campaigns?"
