However, I can **pause** campaigns to stop them from running. \n\nWould you like me to:\n1. **Pause all 3 Signal42 campaigns?**\n2. **Pause a specific one?** (please specify which)\n\nNote: The campaigns appear to have just launched with no spend yet, so pausing them now would prevent any budget from being used."
