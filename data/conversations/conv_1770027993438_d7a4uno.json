      "content": "## 📊 Budget Optimization Recommendations\n\nBased on the analysis of your 5 active campaigns, here are my optimization suggestions:\n\n---\n\n### 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY - Apex Motors** (Health: Poor)\n**Current:** $32,450 spent / $50,000 budget\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n- Mobile CTR (0.08%) is 55% lower than desktop (0.18%)\n- Germany CTR (0.04%) is 71% lower than US/UK (0.14%)\n- High CPA of $721.11\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n1. **Reduce mobile bid by 30-40%** - Mobile spend ($19,470) is highest but lowest performing\n2. **Pause Germany targeting** - $6,490 wasted on poor performance\n3. **Shift budget to desktop** - 2x better CTR performance\n\n**Potential Savings:** ~$8,000-10,000 by reallocating to better performers\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ **URGENT - TechFlow SaaS** (Overspending)\n**Current:** $28,200 spent / $25,000 budget (113% overspend!)\n\n**Issues:**\n- Already exceeded budget by $3,200\n- High CPM ($31.69) but strong performance\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n1. **Set daily budget cap** at ~$150-200 to prevent further overspend\n2. **Consider budget increase** - campaign is performing well (0.6% CTR, 89 conversions)\n\n**Decision Needed:** Pause until next period OR increase budget (recommended)\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **SportMax Apparel** (Health: Good)\n**Current:** $29,800 spent / $35,000 budget\n\n**Opportunities:**\n- Strong 85% video completion rate\n- Good CPA ($234.65) with 127 conversions\n- $5,200 remaining budget\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n1. **Increase daily spend** to utilize remaining budget\n2. **Test expansion** to additional sports interest segments\n3. **Slight desktop bid increase** (+10-15%) - marginally better performance\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **FinanceFirst Bank** (Health: Good)\n**Current:** $22,100 spent / $40,000 budget\n\n**Opportunities:**\n- Excellent 85% viewability\n- Desktop performing well (0.36% CTR)\n- Significant unused budget ($17,900)\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n1. **Shift more budget to desktop** (+20-25%) - clear preference for financial content\n2. **Accelerate pacing** - likely to underdeliver at current rate\n3. **Expand geo targeting** if available to utilize remaining budget\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **GreenEnergy Co** (Health: Good)\n**Current:** $14,900 spent / $20,000 budget\n\n**Opportunities:**\n- California leading with 0.4% CTR\n- Florida underperforming (0.27% CTR)\n- Strong overall CPA ($266.07)\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n1. **Shift budget from Florida to California** (+30-40% to CA)\n2. **Reduce Florida bid by 20-25%** or pause entirely\n3. **Consider Texas expansion** - solid 0.35% CTR performance\n\n---\n\n## 💰 **Summary: Quick Wins**\n\n| Action | Campaign | Expected Impact |\n|--------|----------|----------------|\n| 🛑 Pause Germany | Apex Motors | Save ~$6,500 |\n| 📉 Reduce mobile bid -35% | Apex Motors | Improve CPA by ~$150-200 |\n| 📊 Set daily cap $180 | TechFlow | Stop overspending |\n| 📈 Shift FL→CA budget +35% | GreenEnergy | +15-20% more conversions |\n| 🚀 Increase desktop bid +20% | FinanceFirst | Utilize $17,900 remaining |\n\n**Total Potential Savings/Efficiency Gain:** $15,000-20,000\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to implement any of these optimizations? I can execute these changes immediately."
