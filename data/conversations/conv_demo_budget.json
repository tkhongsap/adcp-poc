      "content": "I'd be happy to help optimize your Q1 budget allocation. Let me analyze your current spend patterns and performance metrics.\n\n## Current Budget Analysis\n\n| Campaign | Budget | Spent | Remaining | Efficiency |\n|----------|--------|-------|-----------|------------|\n| Apex Motors | $50,000 | $32,450 | $17,550 | Low |\n| TechFlow SaaS | $25,000 | $18,200 | $6,800 | High |\n| SportMax | $75,000 | $45,000 | $30,000 | High |\n| HomeStyle | $20,000 | $12,800 | $7,200 | Medium |\n| FreshBite | $15,000 | $8,500 | $6,500 | Low |\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Reduce Apex Motors budget by 20%** - Poor health metrics indicate inefficient spend. Consider pausing underperforming geo targets.\n\n2. **Increase TechFlow SaaS budget by 15%** - High efficiency and good health suggest room for scale.\n\n3. **Maintain SportMax budget** - Excellent performance, current allocation is optimal.\n\n4. **Reallocate FreshBite budget** - Campaign is paused. Consider redistributing to high-performers.\n\nWould you like me to implement any of these changes?"
